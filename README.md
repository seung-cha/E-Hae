# E-Hae: E-book reader for language learners
E-Hae (means understanding in Korean) is an E-book reader for language learners. E-Hae integrates definition search and Anki to facilitate your language learning journey.

Note that E-Hae is not an E-book service provider. Users are expected to procure PDF or Epub files to use with E-Hae.

E-Hae is currently in early development.



## Features
As E-Hae is still very early in development, no features are concrete.

However, these features below are promised to be implemented in the final product:
* Integrated definition search in various languages using public dictionary APIs such as [free dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev) or [Jisho](https://jisho.org/forum/54fefc1f6e73340b1f160000-is-there-any-kind-of-search-api).

* Link with Anki to add flash cards to an Anki deck

* Library and book management system to manage different books
